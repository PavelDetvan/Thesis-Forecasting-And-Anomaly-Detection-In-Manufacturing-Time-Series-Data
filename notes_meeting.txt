- measurements are dependent
- some points correlated (although not that much, I will try also XYZ)
- cleaned data
- add uncertainty of prediction
- 



questions
- normalize??? - depends on the alg used
- imbalance in class - but maybe not a problem as we predict the meas_values - not a problem anymore
- resample?? - research how to tackle this = during gaps maybe something resets - maybe split the time series into smaller ones - changes in distribution over time etc, find something systematic
- features (lags, cummulative, rolling stats, time/shift, time_diff)
- output (range (split into bins and predict to which bin it will fall) or exact value - investigate uncertainity)
- how to deal with weekends/no-production/gaps
